# Machine Learning Midterm Project

## Overview
This repository contains the final version of my Machine Learning midterm project, implemented using Jupyter Notebook. The project involves the application of machine learning techniques to solve a specific problem, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and analysis.

## Project Structure
- **Notebook**: `MLN-MIDTERM-FINAL.ipynb` - The Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, visualizations, and detailed explanations of the steps involved in the project.
- **Data**: The dataset used for this project (if not included within the notebook, provide instructions on how to access or load the data).
- **Models**: Details of the machine learning models used, including hyperparameters, training processes, and evaluation metrics.

## Key Components
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to clean and prepare the data for modeling, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Model Selection**: Explanation of the machine learning models chosen for the task, along with justifications for their use.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Description of the training process, including cross-validation techniques, and the metrics used to evaluate model performance.
- **Results and Analysis**: Detailed analysis of the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and any visualizations that help in understanding the results.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-midterm-project.git
   cd ml-midterm-project
